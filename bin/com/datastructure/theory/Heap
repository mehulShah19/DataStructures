HeapMap
- binary tree
- complete tree will have all leaf node on the left side and is balanced

minHeap 
- All the element on the node is smaller than or equal to the child

add - 
Add some element in the last leaf and keep moving upward if parent is greater than the child


remove min() -
remove the head or the root of the tree
replace with the element stored in the last leaf 
then move down if the element is smaller than the root keep moving down till both the elements are not smaller than the current last node

Heap Priority Queues -
Priority and if same priority then FirstIn First Out basis

MaxHeap can be used
for arranging we can use the priority and then the order of the node

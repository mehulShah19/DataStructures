Ierator

hasNext()
next()
remove() - Mostly not implemented

Only if the class is iterable
we can use for each loop

Note that there is no assumption about the order in which an 
Iterator object delivers the elements from the collection.

Another issue surrounding the use of iterators is what happens if the collection is modified while the iterator is in use. 
Most of the collections in the Java Collections API are implemented to be fail-fast. 
This simply means that they will, or should, throw an exception if the collection is modified while the iterator is in use
